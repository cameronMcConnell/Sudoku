# Sudoku
Fully functional sudoku board that lets you select between easy, medium, and hard level boards. Included is a button that will solve the board for you, a button to check if your solution is corrent, and a button that will clear the current board for you. The current difficulty will be displayed above the said buttons to avoid any confusion. The program does not generate the boards but instead uses the suGoku api found here, https://github.com/bertoort/sugoku. Every other function such as displaying the board, solving the board, and checking the board were coded by myself using previous knowledge on these algorithms and my current knowledge of React.
